The Web is still sprawling with new projects. From a specialist point-of-view,
there is hardly any idle time. Not a week passes by without someone asking for
input on a project. It seems the community efforts on building FOSS technologies
to make Web development accessible and affordable has finally paid off.

Freelancing is the opportunity to listen to new ideas and help out these
projects as they grow self-sufficient -- then it's time to move. This is
basically what I miss the most when I'm working full-time: novelty, boldness,
diversity.

So, now I'm back to presenting, documenting, contributing and playing. I hang
around a lot on Freenode IRC, I'm making my own websites (personal and
professional) and I read once again the paid-support forums of the technologies
I know the most. And I'm joining [Toptal Web Engineering Group][toptal] to meet
project owners, fellow developers and job opportunities.

I tried briefly other sites, but quickly realized they were a race to the
bottom: it seemed that jobs were looking for the cheapest assets,
maintainability was an afterthought and there was nothing take from it.

Now compare that to a curated set of developers, showing off their skills in
accurate [technical blogs][posts] and sorted by their skills. That's a community
I want to be a part of! So, while I wait for an approval in their ranks, I've got
a good reading list to fight off. I'll highlight the best ones in my blog.
